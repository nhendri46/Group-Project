		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>There’s a part of every one of us that dreams of a better world. That spark of inspiration to help a person, fix a neighborhood, or even change a nation. At GoFundMe, we believe your inspiration should be shared with everyone. Because that is how change happens.</p>
        <P>That’s why we make it easy to inspire the world and turn compassion into action. By giving people the tools they need to capture and share their story far and wide, we have built a community of more than 50 million donors and helped organizers raise over $5 billion—and we are just getting started.</P>
